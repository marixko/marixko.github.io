## Education

* [2018 - present] Ph.D. in Astronomy - Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. 
* [2014 - 2016] B.Sc. in Astronomy - Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil.
* [2010 - 2013] B.Sc. in Statistics - Instituto de Matemática e Estatística, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. 

## Research Experience
* [2018 - present] Ph.D. thesis 

Advisor: Prof. Claudia Mendes de Oliveia

Evaluated machine learning structures to classify stas, quasars, and galaxies using the S-PLUS photometric dataset. A paper about this project is under revision by MNRAS and a python package is under development. In parallel, other structures are being evaluated to estimate accurate distances for all sources being classified as quasars. Spectroscopic observations of the quasar candidates are under analysis. 

* [2014 - 2016] Undergraduate research

Advisor: Prof Nina Hirata | Co-advisor: Pof. Claudia Mendes de Oliveira

We studied how to classify quasars using Principal Component Analysis on the ALHAMBRA photometric dataset. 



## Academic Projects
* [2019 - present] Editor of the <a href="http://www.splus.iag.usp.br/">S-PLUS website</a>
* [2019] Designed the new layout for the <a href="http://www.splus.iag.usp.br/">S-PLUS website</a> and managed the development process. 
* [2013] Final project of the Statistics program entitled "Evaluation of the risk factors for the occurence of early death after liver transplant". We based our inferencial analysis using logistic regression. Advisors: Prof. Lúcia Pereira Barroso and Prof. Carmen Diva Saldiva Andre.
* [2013] Final project of the Statistics program entitled "Natural breakage or human action of stones excavated from the archaeological site of Boqueirão da Pedra Furada", where we used bayesian regression to perform the classification of the stones. Advisor: Prof. Márcia D'elia Branco
