## Hello there! :)

<div class="about">
    <img class="avatar" src="/assets/img/lilianne.jpg" alt="Lilianne">
    <p class="intro">
        I am Lilianne Nakazono, I am a final-year PhD student in Astronomy at Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas at University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil (yes, I am looking for a postdoc position!). Currently, I am under a 1-year internship at University of Washington, Seattle, US. I majored in Astronomy (2013-2016) and in Statistics (2010-2013). I am member of the S-PLUS collaboration, which is an ongoing all-sky survey that will cover about 9300 squared degrees of the Southern Sky. The main topic of my thesis involves the application of Machine Learning/Deep Learning to find and estimate QSOs with the 12-band S-PLUS photometry. I have worked with QSOs for many years and now I am being adventurous in stellar science too! I see myself as a problem-solver, i.e. I enjoy working with any kind of data.
