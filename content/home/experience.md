Thesis title: "Classification and redshift estimation of new quasars in photometric surveys, using S-PLUS as study case"

Our object classifier is the current primary source to photometrically select stars, quasars or galaxies in S-PLUS DR2, DR3, and DR4. During these years, I had experience with querying, cross-matching and/or analyzing data from S-PLUS, SDSS, WISE, GAIA, GALEX, GAMA, and ALHAMBRA surveys. I have been working on this project since my first year of undergraduate in Astronomy (2014), being supervised by Prof. Nina T. S. Hirata from the Computer Science department of IME-USP at that time.
