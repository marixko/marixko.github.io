 I am a final-year PhD student in Astronomy at Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas at Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. Currently, I am under a 1-year internship at University of Washington, Seattle, US. I am member of the [S-PLUS](https://www.splus.iag.usp.br) collaboration and PI of the project on the search for quasar candidates and estimation of quasar redshifts using Machine Learning. I have worked with QSOs for many years and now I am being adventurous in stellar science too! I see myself as a problem-solver, i.e. I enjoy working with any kind of data.
